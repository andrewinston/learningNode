This is an API to store entities (for now all is stored is the name and a description).

The API also allows users to rate the entity chosen. For instance, this could be used to rate YouTube videos, restaurants, well, generic real world entities

The ratings as of now have two possible types: stars (0 to 5 stars), or thumbs (thumbs up or thumbs down)

Hopefully I'll write instructions on how to utilize the API

Should note that this project was developed in a discipline of distributed systems
